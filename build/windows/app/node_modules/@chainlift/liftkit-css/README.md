# LiftKit CSS

LiftKit CSS is the vanilla CSS version of Chainlift's LiftKit design system. It's a lightweight framework of utility classes that use golden ratio scaling to provide a uniquely "oddly-satisfying" look. 


## Quickstart
These are just vanilla CSS files. You can import everything into your HTML by linking to css/index.css, which in turn imports everything else.

## A Message from the Author

## Disclaimers

* **LiftKit is and will always be free.** I do not believe in gatekeeping knowledge, and I will never, ever, ever charge anybody for using it.

* **LiftKit is funded by Chainlift's project revenue.** If you need a design/dev partner, proceeds from your project fees will go towards further research and refinement of the LiftKit system. [Request a proposal here.](https://www.chainlift.io/request-proposal)

* **Anyone claiming to represent, work for, or be an "expert in" Chainlift or LiftKit is lying.** If they aren't listed on "Who Works Here?" on chainlift.io, they're making it up.
